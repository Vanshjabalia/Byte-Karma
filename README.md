**Description**
 Mentorship is a powerful tool for guiding students through their academic and career journeys.
 With SLIETâ€™s focus on nurturing talent, a mentorship platform can create new opportunities by
 connecting SLIET faculty members with students who need career advice, academic support, or
 skill-building guidance.
 The goal of this challenge is to build a dedicated mentorship website for SLIET, where faculty
 members from our college act as mentors, offering their time to help students with academic
 and career-related queries. This platform will allow students to book one-on-one sessions with
 faculty mentors based on their availability, fostering smooth communication and personalized
 guidance within the SLIET community.
 This initiative will strengthen student-faculty interactions, providing continuous support and
 enhancing the personal and professional growth of students at SLIET.
